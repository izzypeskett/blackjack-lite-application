# Blackjack Lite Software Development Plan 
## Statement of purpose 
Blackjack Lite is an interactive digital version of the popular casino game blackjack. This terminal application allows the user to play rounds of blackjack against a programmed or bot dealer. 

The game is initiated by asking the user for their player name. Once the terminal has recieved this standard input the user gets to enjoy countless rounds of Blackjack. There are only two ways to exit the application
1. If the user's bank account, which begins at $1000, is at less than $10 
2. If the user chooses to exit the application

Otherwise, the application allows the user to continuously get dealt a new hand after each round.
Blackjack Lite follows the standard rules of blackjack; which can be sourced from this [link.](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/) The current version of Blackjack Lite, however, does not allow the user to
- "split" their hand
- call "insurance" 
- "double down" 
- play 5 card charlie 
- reveal the dealers first card when player gets their hand

Once the application has ended the terminal outputs the users playing history. The playing history highlights how many rounds the user played, their betting history and their bank account after each round. 

### Problems being addressed
Blackjack Lite was designed to address the identified problems: 
- the cost involved with having to play blackjack, 
- the need for a dealer,
- having to attend a casino to play blackjack, 
- the complexity of competitor online blackjack games or setting up your own blackjack game

Blackjack Lite addresses the above problems: 

1. It allows the user to practice and finesse their blackjack abilities with minimal risk, as the application is free and requires no upfront cost.

2. The application has a preprogrammed dealer, allowing the user to play individually. 

3. By removing the friction of attending a casino, Blackjack Lite provides an easily accessible form of personal entertainment for users. 

4. Blackjack Lite is designed with simplicity, intended for the user to continuously play with ease. 

### Target Audience
Per law, Blackjack Lite is intended for users who are 18 years or older. The user persona would be those who need a short burst of simple entertainment whilst commuting or waiting. The secondary target audience is users who want to perfect the art of blackjack. Although many would say blackjack is a game of luck. 

Blackjack Lite can be implemented and accessed via the users' smartphone, whilst they have an internet connection and online through their personal computer, laptop or tablet. 

Currently, the application has only been designed to run through the terminal. The ruby code will be run through the terminal where the user will interact with Blackjack Lite.
